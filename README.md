# Giftastic

## Overview
This was my first attempt at utilizing an API. This simple app pulls gifs from Giphy API and places them on the page. It also allows users to input their own search terms and create a custom button which is tied to the Giphy API query. All of the Gifs are displayed collectively on the page with their rating ID displayed in bold.

## Try it Out!
